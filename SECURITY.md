## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerability checks are constantly made against the Repositories, Docker images and Releases.
We strive to resolve any vulnerabilities within 1-2 days.  These resolutions are usually dependent 
upon the upstream project fixing the security issue.  The applied security fixes will result in a new
Docker Image and/or Release.  Please check the latest version to see if the vulnerability has been addressed.

To report a vulnerability please contact Steve Taylor (steve@deployhub.com).
